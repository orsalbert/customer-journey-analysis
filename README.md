# Customer Journey Analysis

The dashboard project analyzes customers' journey on an e-commerce website to understand user behavior and to optimize the marketing strategy. The analysis focuses on building a custom purchase funnel based on tracking data, presenting metrics that describe user behavior, and exploring variations in the customer journey depending on the initial page visited.

## Funnel steps

Based on the data collected in the two weeks timeframe, over 290k users visited the website, resulting in roughly 8.7k orders being placed. The customer journey is described in four steps:

1. Browse: visit and browse the website
2. Product view
3. Add to cart
4. Order

## Insights: Understanding user behavior

A significant number of users are visiting the website and spending time browsing and viewing products.There is a notable above 90% drop in engagement from viewing products to adding items to the cart. Only half of the users who add items to their cart proceed to complete their purchase. This might indicate potential room for improvement in the checkout process. Fewer users land on the Search Listing Page leading to fewer orders compared to the Listing Page, which generates more activity and purchases. The Product Page is the top landing page, but it shows low further engagement and an even lower order placement rate (below 0.5%). The highest number of purchases come from users who land directly on the order page. Interestingly, these users place more orders than they place items in the cart, suggesting possible external transactions or repeated purchases. As data suggests, driving traffic to the Search Listing Page could result in higher engagement and ultimately more orders.

## Additional findigs

Insights on unusual user behavior.

Insights on the number of users by day that:

- only viewed products in their first session
- added only one product to the basket
- placed an order within two days time after the first session

## Further information required to drive better results:

- Traffic sources: how do users arrive to the website (directly, organic search, paid search, social media, email campaigns)?
- Session duration: how much time do users spend at each stage of the funnel?
- User demographics: location, age, gender - where do users come from? Understand target audience engagement better.
